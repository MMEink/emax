          <p className="paragraph">
            Email marketing continues to be a great way for businesses to reach
            their target audience directly. Through well-planned email
            campaigns, itâ€™s possible to increase customer retention with
            informative newsletters or product updates, or create urgent
            customer demand with exciting giveaways or promotions that feel like
            big rewards.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            Emails can also be used to drive traffic back to the business
            website or social media platforms while also providing subscribers
            with easy access to customer service and help. With the ability to
            precisely target the most relevant audiences and measure results in
            real time, this strategy helps you measure success and create
            further engagement with customers.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            This helps you build stronger relationships in your industry, and
            ultimately increases the likelihood of higher ROI over time. At
            E-Max Interactive, our team of email marketing experts can help you
